> ⚠️ **Note:** This project was originally forked from [`shashvik/gandiva-xspm`](https://github.com/shashvik/gandiva-xspm), but that repository has since been deleted. This repository is now maintained independently. Major parts of the original codebase were authored by [shashvik](https://github.com/shashvik). Credit goes to him for the core architecture and initial implementation.

Gandiva is an advanced Extended Security Posture Management (xSPM) platform designed to help organizations monitor, assess, and improve their cloud security posture across multi-cloud environments. It offers deep visibility into cloud assets, detects security issues, and provides actionable remediation guidance.

    cd gandiva-xspm
    ```

2. **Build Docker images:**  
   > Note: Image builds may take several minutes. Please be patient.
   ```bash
   docker build -t gandiva-backend -f Dockerfile.backend . 
   docker build -t gandiva-frontend -f Dockerfile.frontend .
   ```

3. **Start the containers:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x start_gandiva.sh
   ./start_gandiva.sh
   ```

### Docker Compose Deployment

For a simpler deployment:

1. **Clone the repository:**

## 🔍 Cloud Resource Scanning

Gandiva leverages **Steampipe** to scan multi-cloud resources.

### AWS Configuration

Ensure AWS CLI is set up with valid credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

### Kubernetes Configuration

Ensure your `~/.kube/config` file is properly configured and has access to your cluster.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- All endpoints are protected using JWT token authentication.
- Role-based access control for administrative functions.
- Secure storage of cloud credentials.
- Token refresh mechanism for persistent sessions.
